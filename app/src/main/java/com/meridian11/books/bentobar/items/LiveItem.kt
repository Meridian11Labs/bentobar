/**
 * Live activity: the one thing happening right now, from whichever types can say so ([ItemType.liveSource]): a call, a
 * timer that has rung, a meeting about to start, a running timer, a Focus session, a flight from boarding to landing,
 * another app's progress, what plays. The highest rank stands in the bar ([LiveRules.first]); the popup lists them all.
 *
 * It names no source: they are the registered types that say they are one, each with a switch in the item's options. A
 * source switched on is kept live with the item ([wakes]: its `onLive`, `sample` and `onIdle`, never its `state`), so
 * [sample] asks each for its [ItemType.liveNow], at the pace its own item would be recomputed, and keeps the answers in
 * memory; [state] reads them. What they say can be a track's title or another app's words: it is never logged, never
 * printed by the debug hook and gone when the item goes idle ([discreet]).
