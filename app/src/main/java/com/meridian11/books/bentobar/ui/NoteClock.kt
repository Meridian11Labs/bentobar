/**
 * How long a note with Undo stands: the slip in a removed row's place, the one for a closed or a removed area, the
 * library's "Added", Look's line. One rule for all of them. A note goes [Motion.NOTE] after it appeared. The time waits
 * while the pointer is over the note or the keyboard is in it, and starts again, whole, when they have left: nobody
 * reaches for an Undo that goes under the hand. The pointer is over a note once it has moved there: a note that came
 * under a pointer at rest (the one that clicked an area's trash, where the note's Undo then stands) is not pointed at
 * and goes in its time. A new change replaces the note, as ever. When the time is up only the
 * note goes ([Undo.noteOver]): Ctrl+Z takes the change back until the next one. And in its first moment a note's Undo
 * takes no pointer's press ([deafAtFirst]).
