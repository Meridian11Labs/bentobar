/**
 * Camera and mic: shows while another app uses a camera or records from the microphone, for how long, and whether the
 * microphone is muted; its menu can mute the microphone for every app. From Android's own callbacks (a camera that is
 * unavailable is in use; a recording that is not silenced is the microphone in use), which need no permission. BentoBar's own
 * Mirror is no call ([MirrorOpen]).
 *
 * The mute is BentoBar's while it holds it ([MuteKeeper]), and it gives it back at the moments [settle] names: the item
 * leaving the layout, the service ending, a start that finds no such item placed. The bar hiding is none of them, so a mute
 * outlives a full-screen call. A rebind of the service ends it too (it can't be told from the service ending). A mute that is
 * not BentoBar's is shown and left alone. The camera can't be switched off by an app: the menu leads to Android's privacy
 * settings for that.
