/**
 * Prompter: the user's notes in a popup that stays open, moving up at the pace they speak so the line being read is
 * the one at the top, nearest the camera. A press beside the popup gives the keys back to the app below (a call), a
 * press inside takes them again; while it has them, Space plays and pauses. Nothing moves where nobody reads it: the
 * script stops where it is when the popup goes, and waits there for the next opening.
 *
 * The script is the user's own words ([discreet]): written in the item's options, kept under the item's id in the
 * no-backup directory (`Kept.own("prompter")`) and in memory once read, never in the layout (which Copy settings and a
 * backup carry), and never in a log line or a debug hook's output.
