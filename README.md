## What it does

BentoBar puts **your own items** into the empty part of the status bar, right next to the
system's icons, in the same font and colour. Items you don't need all the time can show only while
they have something to say, or wait **behind the ‹ button**: one click reveals them, another folds
them away. Like a bento box: everything in its compartment, and the whole thing neat.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/bar.png" width="880" alt="The status bar with BentoBar folded, then with its hidden items revealed">
  <br><sub>With hidden items behind ‹ (a Look setting; the default shows everything that fits), folded (top) and revealed (bottom): a world clock, battery and memory slide in next to the running timer.</sub>
</p>

- **Show when active:** a hidden item can pop out on its own while it has something to say, such
  as a running timer, a meeting about to start or a busy CPU, and disappear again after. Its
  settings say the rule in words ("Show when CPU load is above 80%") and let you set the number.
- **Drag to reorder** in settings, within a section or into another one.
- **Click any item** for its menu: charts, details and actions.
- **Right-click an item** to hide it, move it or change how it looks.
- **Scroll** over the sound item to change the volume, or over the timer to add minutes. The sound
  item can also draw a **volume slider** right in the bar.
- **Quick Settings tiles** switch BentoBar off (for presenting), keep the screen awake, or start a
  25-minute timer.
- **Live Update chip:** when BentoBar is off, a running timer still shows as Android's own status
  bar chip.

BentoBar stays out of the way. It moves aside when the system's own icons or chips change, and
hides when an app goes full screen or the screen locks.

## Install

BentoBar is made for Googlebooks (Googlebook OS, Android 17). Other Android 14+ devices with a
status bar may work, but haven't been tested.

1. On your Googlebook, download
   **[BentoBar.apk](../../releases/latest/download/BentoBar.apk)** from the latest release.
2. Open it from Chrome's downloads or the Files app. If Android asks, allow Chrome (or Files) to
   install apps, then tap **Install**. Google Play Protect may then say *"App blocked to protect
   your device"* because it hasn't seen an app from this developer before: tap **More details** ›
   **Install anyway**.
3. Open **BentoBar**. It says what its accessibility service does and asks whether you agree:
   **Agree** opens Android's Accessibility settings. (Later, the same is under **Setup** › **Turn on**.)
4. Because BentoBar came from a download, Android guards this switch the first time:
   1. Open **BentoBar** and tap the switch. Android says *"Restricted setting"*. Tap **OK**.
   2. Back in BentoBar, open **Setup** and tap **App info**, then **⋮** (top right) › **Allow restricted
      settings**, and confirm with your PIN.
   3. Return to Accessibility › **BentoBar** and turn it on.
5. Optional: in **Setup**, allow notifications (timer alerts, the Live Update chip) and calendar
   access (Next meeting, events in the month view).

About a day later, Android shows *"Review app with full device access"*. That's a standard check
for every app that uses an accessibility service. Keep BentoBar if you're happy with what it does
(below).

To update, install a newer `BentoBar.apk` over the old one; your layout stays.

<a id="privacy"></a>
## Privacy: why an accessibility service, and what BentoBar does with it

Android lets an app draw on top of the status bar only through an accessibility service, so
Android warns that BentoBar can "view and control your screen". Here is everything BentoBar does
with that access:

- It listens only for **windows appearing, going or moving**, not their content, so it can hide
  for full-screen apps and shades.
- It reads the **status bar's layout**, to find free space, and **where other windows are**, never what is
  in them, to hide for full-screen apps and panels and to keep your items matching the status bar.
- It copies the **colour of the status bar clock**, from a picture of the status bar's own window
  (not your screen), so your items match.
- It runs **system actions** (screenshot, lock, overview, all apps, notifications, Quick Settings,
  power) when you pick them in the Tools menu or click a Shortcut item.

BentoBar never reads what is in another app's window and doesn't watch your keyboard, mouse or touches.

**BentoBar goes online for six items only, and only after you set them up** on this device:

- **Weather** sends [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) the city you search for, and for the forecast
  the coordinates of the city you pick, rounded to about a kilometre: about every 30 minutes while the
  bar is on screen, and when you open its menu or press Refresh. Open-Meteo sees your IP address, as
  any website does. With **My location** instead of a city, BentoBar asks Android for the device's
  approximate location (never the precise one) while that item is in the bar or waits in Hidden to show for
  rain or snow, or while BentoBar's settings window is open: every 30 minutes once it knows, and when
  Android doesn't, again after 1, 2, 5 and 15 minutes, then every 30. It sends
  Open-Meteo that location rounded to about 10 km. BentoBar asks only for Android's "while using the
  app" permission, not for background location. Where you are, and its forecast, are kept
  in memory only: never on the device, in your layout or in its backup.
- **Air quality & UV** sends Open-Meteo what Weather does (the city you search for, then the city's
  coordinates or, with My location, where the device is, rounded in the same way): about every 30
  minutes while the bar is on screen, and when you open its menu or press Refresh. Its readings are
  kept in memory only. Weather's switch in Setup › Online services covers it too.
- **Exchange rates** asks [Frankfurter](https://frankfurter.dev) for the European Central Bank's
  reference table of currencies, about once an hour while the bar is on screen (a failed try is repeated sooner), and when you open
  its menu or press Refresh. No key is needed, and the pairs you follow and the converter's amounts are
  worked out on the device. Frankfurter sees your IP address, as any website does.
- **Flight** sends [AirLabs](https://airlabs.co) the flight number and your own AirLabs key: when you
  track a flight, when you press Refresh, and while it follows the flight (about every 3 hours, then
  every 30 minutes or sooner from 3 hours before departure until it lands). AirLabs sees your IP
  address and can tie lookups to your key's account. BentoBar ships no key.
- **US stocks** sends [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io) your own Finnhub key with the symbol of each stock you
  follow: every 2 minutes while the US market is open and the bar is on screen, once after the close,
  and when you open its menu, press Refresh or save a new key. Its search sends what you type when you
  press Search.
  Finnhub sees your IP address and can tie requests to your key's account. BentoBar ships no key.
- **Value from a URL** asks the one address you typed for it, and nothing else: as often as you set,
  never more than once a minute, while the bar is on screen. The address must be HTTPS, with no name
  or password in it; a redirect is not followed and a reply over 64 KB is dropped. The address is kept
  on this device only: not in your layout, a copied layout or a backup. It has a switch of its own in
  Setup › Online services, Your own addresses. Whoever runs that address sees your IP address.

Requests can go to those four services, to the one address you type for each Value from a URL item,
and nowhere else (the code has no other way to name an address), **Setup › Online services** switches
each off, and a layout pasted from another install never turns them on. BentoBar sends nothing else
anywhere: not your layout, your calendar, your clipboard, your notifications, the camera's picture,
what's playing or anything it measures. It has no accounts of its own, no ads and no analytics, and it
sends its developer nothing.

**Clipboard** reads the text you copy while the item is in use, and keeps your last few copies in
memory only: they are gone when BentoBar stops, and are never stored or sent. The snippets you pin are
saved with the item, in your layout.

**Now playing** reads the title, artist and artwork your media players publish, which Android shares
only with apps that have notification access. That access is optional, and BentoBar tells Android to
send it no notifications through that entry, and receives none. Without it the item still shows that something plays and
controls it. Nothing about what you play is stored or sent.

**Notification icons** has its own entry in Android's Notification access list, "BentoBar notification
icons", off until you turn it on. With it BentoBar reads other apps' notifications (the app, the
title, the text, the icon, a progress), only while an item that shows them is on screen, and holds
them in memory only. The bar shows icons, never words; the popup lists them, by app and title alone if
you switch "What they say" off. Nothing of them is stored, logged or sent.

**Mirror** uses the Camera permission, asked for when you first open it. The camera runs only while
its popup is open, and the picture is never recorded, stored or sent.

**Camera and mic** learns from Android that a camera or a microphone is in use, not which app uses it.
Its button mutes the microphone for every app, and only when you press it; BentoBar unmutes when you
remove the item or turn BentoBar off, and leaves alone a mute Android or another app made. It can't
switch a camera off.

**Shelf** keeps the text and links you drop on it or add from the clipboard, and **Prompter** keeps
your notes: on this device only, not in your layout, a copied layout or a backup, and never sent.
Forget, in Add items, deletes them.

If you use Android's backup, Android keeps a copy of BentoBar's settings in your Google account. Your
AirLabs and Finnhub keys, the online switches, the addresses of Value from a URL, a Prompter's notes,
what a Shelf holds, a Focus session, your answer to the accessibility explanation, a running timer and
keep awake are left out of it.

**Usage access is optional and off by default.** If you turn it on (Setup, or the Network and
Storage menus), BentoBar reads how much data and storage each app uses, to list the top five in
those menus. Android's switch also covers which apps you use and when. BentoBar reads that only for a
**Screen time** item you put in the bar: when the screen went on and off today, and, while its menu is
open, which apps were in front and for how long. None of it is stored or sent, and it is forgotten
when the menu closes. Turn it off any time in Android's Usage access settings (Setup › Usage access ›
Open setting takes you there).
Android doesn't share other apps' CPU or memory use with apps at all, so the CPU and Memory menus
show the whole system instead.

| Notification access *(optional)* | Now playing's title, artist and artwork; BentoBar receives no notifications through this entry |
| Notification access, "BentoBar notification icons" *(optional)* | Notification icons, and other apps' progress in Live activity; read while on screen, never stored |
| Network state, launcher apps | the network menu, and picking apps for shortcuts |

## Good to know

- **System icons stay.** Android doesn't let an installed app hide or reorder the system's own
  icons (clock, Wi-Fi, battery, notifications), so BentoBar organises its own items next to them.
- **Keyboard shortcut.** The launcher entry **BentoBar menu** opens BentoBar's menu with every item
  in it: arrows and Enter open an item's menu, Escape closes it. Give it a shortcut in the system's
  keyboard shortcuts (Action + / › Customize), e.g. Action + T. BentoBar itself doesn't read keys.
- **One chip.** Android shows one Live Update chip per app, with about seven characters of text,
  and hides it while that app's own window is open.
- **CPU load** comes from each core's idle time (Android doesn't let apps read overall CPU usage),
  and matches the system's `top` within a point or two.
- **Advanced Protection** (Android 17) turns off accessibility services that aren't assistive
  tools, and with it BentoBar's bar. The chip and tiles keep working.
- **Light on battery:** about 0.5% of one CPU core with the CPU and network items updating every
  second, and nothing at all while the screen is off.

## Build

Needs JDK 21 and the Android SDK (platform 37).

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug      # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease    # signed if ~/.config/bentobar/keystore.jks and keystore.pass exist
```

`./bento` is the development helper (build, install, enable, test hooks, screenshots) for a
Googlebook connected over Wireless debugging. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) explains how the code is
organised, and [docs/research](docs/research) has the platform findings behind the design.

Releases are built and signed by GitHub Actions when a `v<version>` tag is pushed, so nobody needs
the release key on their machine: see [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).
